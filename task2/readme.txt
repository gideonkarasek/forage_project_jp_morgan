Task 2 instructions:

You should write a function that is able to use the data you created previously to price the contract. The client may want to choose multiple dates to inject and withdraw a set amount of gas, so your approach should generalize the explanation from before. Consider all the cash flows involved in the product.

The input parameters that should be taken into account for pricing are:

1. Injection dates. 
2. Withdrawal dates.
3. The prices at which the commodity can be purchased/sold on those dates.
4. The rate at which the gas can be injected/withdrawn.
5. The maximum volume that can be stored.
6. Storage costs.
